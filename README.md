1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.
2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.
3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.
4. Submit the repository link for grading.

## Project Setup

Built with;
  javaScript
  HTML

## Setup Instructions 
Create a new repository on github
Open the Terminal command line: [CTRL+ALT+T]
Clone the newly created repository using git clone 
Change Directory: [cd phase-1-week-1-code-challenge]
Navigate to the repository on the machine and Create three folders using mkdir, within the folders have an index.html file and index.js file, create using touch, the folders are named as follows, 
1. challenge1

## Project Description
1.Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator 
Requirement: Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

Solution: if else statement is used to compare given marks and output grades based on marks entered. 

 
2.Challenge 2: Speed Detector 
Requirement: Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

Solution: if else statement is used to compare given speed and output total points accumulated in every speed range and issue demerit points when speed is exceeded

 
3.Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator 
Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.

Solution: After declaring variables, if else statement is used to compare given deductions and output a net salary
